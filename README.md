Generate Characters Combinations Table

"Generate Characters Combinations Table" code allows users to specify the number of characters for combinations they want to generate. When the user enters a valid number and clicks the "Generate" button, the code generates a table for each character in the English alphabet and numbers, displaying all possible combinations of the specified length. The combinations are shown in a tabular format with the combination count and the actual combination.

Finally, the total count of all combinations is displayed above the generated tables once the generation process is complete.
